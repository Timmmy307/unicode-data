The **middle‑school track** (grades 6‑9) is a team‑based competition that teaches students the fundamentals of cyber‑defense, networking, and system administration while protecting a simulated “virtual” network.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 1. How the Competition Works  \\n\\n| Phase | What Happens | Typical Time Commitment |\\n|-------|--------------|--------------------------|\\n| **Qualification (Online) – “CyberPatriot Elementary & Middle School Competition (E‑M)”** | Teams (2‑4 students) receive a **virtual image** of a Windows or Linux network that has intentional security flaws (mis‑configurations, vulnerable services, etc.). Using a provided **CyberPatriot Academy** platform, you must **hard‑enforce** the image: disable unnecessary services, patch OS, set strong passwords, configure firewalls, etc. | Usually 1‑2 hours per round; schools run several rounds (often 4‑6) over the school year. |\\n| **Scoring** | Each round is scored automatically. Points are earned for: <br>• **System Hardening** (removing vulnerabilities) <br>• **System Availability** (keeping services up) <br>• **Documentation** (optional bonus) | Scores are posted online; the top‑scoring teams advance. |\\n| **Finals (Live‑Event)** | The top 50‑70 teams are invited to a live competition at a regional venue (or virtual “CyberPatriot Finals” in recent years). Teams work on a more complex network under time pressure. | 6‑8 hours on the event day, plus travel if it’s in‑person. |\\n| **Awards & Scholarships** | Individual and team trophies, plus scholarship opportunities for high‑schoolers who continue to the next level (CyberPatriot High‑School). | — |\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 2. Getting Started – Step‑by‑Step Checklist  \\n\\n| Step | Action | Resources |\\n|------|--------|-----------|\\n| **1️⃣ Form a Team** | • 2‑4 students (ideally a mix of skill levels). <br>• One **Team Coach** (teacher, parent, or mentor) who can register the team and supervise. | AFA CyberPatriot website – “Register a Team” page. |\\n| **2️⃣ Register** | • Create an account on **CyberPatriot.org**. <br>• Choose the **Elementary & Middle School** competition. <br>• Provide school info, coach details, and team roster. | <https://www.cyberpatriot.org/> |\\n| **3️⃣ Complete the Academy** | • **CyberPatriot Academy** (free online learning platform). <br>• Modules: *Introduction to Cybersecurity*, *Operating Systems*, *Networking Basics*, *Security Best Practices*, *Team Collaboration*. <br>• Earn **Certificates** after each module. | Academy portal – login after registration. |\\n| **4️⃣ Practice with the “Practice Image”** | • Download the **Practice Virtual Image** (Windows 10 or Ubuntu). <br>• Install it on a local machine or use the **CyberPatriot Virtual Lab** (browser‑based). <br>• Use tools like **PowerShell**, **Command Prompt**, **Linux terminal**, **Group Policy**, **Windows Defender**, **iptables**, etc. | Practice image links are provided in the Academy; also on the **CyberPatriot Discord** community. |\\n| **5️⃣ Set Up Your Workstation** | • **Virtualization**: Install **VirtualBox** (free) or **VMware Workstation Player**. <br>• Allocate at least **4 GB RAM** and **50 GB storage** per VM. <br>• Keep a **snapshot** of the original image for resetting between practice runs. | VirtualBox download: <https://www.virtualbox.org/> |\\n| **6️⃣ Run a Mock Competition** | • Simulate a full round: start the VM, apply hardening steps, submit a **score screenshot** (or use the built‑in scoring tool). <br>• Review the **post‑round report** to see what was missed. | Scoring tools are bundled with the competition image. |\\n| **7️⃣ Compete!** | • Log into the competition portal at the scheduled time. <br>• Work together, document changes, and submit the final **score** before the deadline. | Competition schedule is posted on the portal. |\\n| **8️⃣ Review & Improve** | • After each round, debrief: what worked, what didn’t, time spent on each task. <br>• Update a **team wiki** (Google Docs, Notion, etc.) with “hardening checklist” for future rounds. | Example checklist PDFs are on the Academy. |\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 3. Core Skills You’ll Learn  \\n\\n| Category | Key Concepts | Typical Tools |\\n|----------|--------------|---------------|\\n| **Operating‑System Hardening** | Patch management, disabling unnecessary services, secure password policies, account lockout settings. | Windows Update, **gpedit.msc**, **PowerShell**, **apt‑get**, **snap**, **systemctl** |\\n| **Network Security** | Configuring firewalls, limiting open ports, securing remote access (RDP/SSH). | Windows Defender Firewall, **iptables**, **ufw**, **Wireshark** (for analysis) |\\n| **User & Permission Management** | Least‑privilege principle, group policy, file‑system ACLs. | **net user**, **Local Users and Groups**, **chmod**, **chown** |\\n| **Logging & Monitoring** | Enabling audit logs, reviewing Event Viewer, syslog. | Event Viewer, **journalctl**, **Logwatch** |\\n| **Documentation** | Writing clear change logs, creating a “hardening report”. | Markdown, Google Docs, **Git** (optional) |\\n| **Team Collaboration** | Division of tasks, time management, communication. | Discord, Microsoft Teams, shared task boards (Trello, Kanban). |\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 4. Free Study Materials & Communities  \\n\\n| Resource | What It Offers | Link |\\n|----------|----------------|------|\\n| **CyberPatriot Academy** | Structured video lessons + quizzes (covers everything you need for the middle‑school competition). | <https://academy.cyberpatriot.org/> |\\n| **CyberPatriot Community Discord** | Chat with other teams, ask questions, share screenshots, get hints (official moderators enforce rules). | Invite link is sent after registration. |\\n| **CyberPatriot YouTube Channel** | Past competition walkthroughs, coach tips, “How‑to” videos. | <https://www.youtube.com/c/CyberPatriot> |\\n| **CompTIA IT Fundamentals (ITF+)** | Optional but great for background on hardware, OS, networking.

Sample “Hardening Checklist” (Middle‑School Image)\\n\\n> **Before you start, take a screenshot of the initial desktop and note the IP address.**  \\n\\n| # | Task | Windows Commands / Steps | Linux Commands / Steps |\\n|---|------|--------------------------|------------------------|\\n| 1 | **Update the OS** | `Settings → Update & Security → Windows Update → Check for updates` | `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y` |\\n| 2 | **Create a strong admin password** | `Computer Management → Local Users and Groups → Users → Right‑click Administrator → Set Password` | `sudo passwd root` |\\n| 3 | **Disable unnecessary services** | `services.msc → Disable “Print Spooler”, “Remote Registry”, “Bluetooth Support Service”` | `sudo systemctl disable bluetooth.service` |\\n| 4 | **Enable Windows Defender Firewall** | `Control Panel → Windows Defender Firewall → Turn on` | `sudo ufw enable` |\\n| 5 | **Close unused ports** | `netstat -an` → identify ports > 0, then block via firewall | `sudo ufw deny 23/tcp` (example) |\\n| 6 | **Set account lockout policy** | `gpedit.msc → Computer Configuration → Windows Settings → Security Settings → Account Policies → Account Lockout Threshold → 5 invalid attempts` | Edit `/etc/pam.d/common-auth` to add `deny=5` (optional) |\\n| 7 | **Enable audit logging** | `Local Security Policy → Advanced Audit Policy Configuration → Log Success/Failure for logon events` | `sudo apt install auditd && sudo systemctl enable auditd` |\\n| 8 | **Remove default unnecessary user accounts** | `lusrmgr.msc → Users → Delete/disable “Guest”` | `sudo deluser --remove-home guest` |\\n| 9 | **Secure RDP/SSH** | If RDP is enabled, limit to specific IPs via firewall rule. | Ensure `PermitRootLogin no` in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`. |\\n|10| **Document everything** | Keep a simple text file `hardening_log.txt` with timestamps and actions. | Same – use `nano hardening_log.txt`. |\\n\\n> **Tip:** After each change, **reboot** the VM and verify the service is still running (or intentionally stopped) before moving on.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 6. Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them  \\n\\n| Issue | Why It Happens | Fix / Prevention |\\n|-------|----------------|------------------|\\n| **Forgetting to reboot** after a patch or policy change. | Some settings only take effect after a restart. | Add “Reboot VM” as a final checklist item. |\\n| **Disabling a critical service** (e.g., Windows Update). | Over‑hardening can break availability scoring. | Review the **“Required Services”** list in the competition rules before disabling anything. |\\n| **Running as the wrong user** (e.g., using a non‑admin account to apply policies). | Permissions errors cause tasks to fail. | Always work from an **Administrator** or **root** prompt. |\\n| **Missing the submission deadline** due to time‑zone confusion. | Competition times are listed in EST. | Convert to your local time zone and set a calendar reminder 15 min before the deadline. |\\n| **Not documenting changes** (lost points in “documentation bonus”). | Teams sometimes skip the log because they’re focused on hardening. | Keep a running log during the round; copy‑paste into a final report at the end. |\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 7. Scholarships & Next Steps  \\n\\n| Path | What It Leads To | Typical Benefits |\\n|------|------------------|------------------|\\n| **CyberPatriot High‑School Competition** | Continue on to the HS track (grades 10‑12). | Up to **$2,500** scholarships per student, plus college‑prep resources. |\\n| **AFCEA STEM Scholarships** | Awarded to top‑scoring middle‑school teams that advance to finals. | $1,000–$2,000 scholarships for individual students. |\\n| **CyberPatriot College‑Prep Program** | Mentorship, internships, and networking with industry partners. | Resume‑building, potential internships with DoD contractors. |\\n\\n*Check the **CyberPatriot Awards** page each year for the exact scholarship amounts and eligibility criteria.*\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 8. Quick “First‑Round” Action Plan (30‑Minute Sprint)\\n\\n1. **Power‑on the VM** and take an initial screenshot.  \\n2. **Run Windows Update** (or `apt update && apt upgrade`). Let it finish (≈ 5 min).  \\n3. **Set a strong admin password** (≈ 2 min).  \\n4. **Enable the firewall** and **block all inbound ports** except 3389 (RDP) or 22 (SSH) if needed (≈ 3 min).  \\n5. **Disable three obvious unnecessary services** (Print Spooler, Bluetooth, Remote Registry) (≈ 3 min).  \\n6. **Create a hardening log file** and record each step with timestamps (≈ 2 min).  \\n7. **Reboot** the VM (≈ 5 min).  \\n8. **Verify** that the services you disabled are still stopped (`services.msc` / `systemctl status`).  \\n9. **Submit the score** and take a final screenshot.  \\n\\nThat sprint typically nets **~70‑80 %** of the possible points, leaving the remaining time for fine‑tuning (e.g., tightening firewall rules, configuring audit logs).\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 9. Where to Ask for Help  \\n\\n- **Official CyberPatriot Support** – via the portal’s “Help” button.  \\n- **Discord #middle‑school‑help** – post screenshots, ask for hints (no spoilers).  \\n- **Your Team Coach** – they can contact the AFA regional liaison for clarification.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n### TL;DR\\n\\n1. **Register** a 2‑4‑student team with a coach.  \\n2. Complete the **CyberPatriot Academy** modules.  \\n3. Install the **practice VM** in VirtualBox/VMware.  \\n4. Follow a **hardening checklist** (updates, passwords, firewall, services, logging).  \\n5. **Document** everything, reboot, and submit before the deadline.  \\n6. Review the score, improve, and repeat for each round.  \\n7. Advance to **finals**, earn **awards**, and unlock **scholarships** for future years.\\n\\nGood luck, CyberPatriot!
